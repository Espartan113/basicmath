This code is for practicing propouse, but it also is maybe helping for other people.
I will work on the code at https://github.com/Espartan113.

That code has the porpouse of create a basic (and not so basic) mathematical funtions for physics and math programming, with the objective to transform it in a c++ library.
I'm still working on the code, and learning c++, so I'm an amateur user.

You can use my code without any problems, if you want to comment back, optimize it, add stuffs or anything, you can with or without mention anyone.
Buy if you want mention or share the new code, I'll thank you.

-------- ABOUT THE CONTENT --------
The file contains a commented version which I'll use it to understand what's going on on the code, you can use it for the same; and another version, that I called "optimized version".
In the optimized vertuon, I deleted all the spaces and the comments to be lighter.

-------- ABOUT THIS VERSION --------
Beta 0.1
- It includes the functions:
	1.- Absolute number (absmum): It transform a negative or positive number in its absolite value, it means, the positive number.
	2.- Power (power): It gives you a number powered to a certain value, it works (at last) with positive, negative and cero value. Doesn't work with fraccionated nunm
